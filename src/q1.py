"""
This question does not contain starter code.

Create a function decorator called timer that measures and prints how long a function takes to execute.

The decorator should:

1. Print a message when the function starts executing
2. Measure the execution time
3. Print the execution time when the function finishes in this format: "Executed <function_name> in <time_taken>ms"
4. Return the original function's result, unchanged

Then, create a sample function and test it out!

Hint: the type annotation for a function that takes any arguments and returns any value is Callable[..., Any]
