This question does not contain starter code.

Create a class decorator called add_counter that automatically adds methods to track how many times any method of the class has been called.

Your decorator should:

- Add a get_call_count() method that returns the total number of method calls
- Add a reset_counter() method that resets the count to zero
- Track calls to all methods except special methods (those starting and ending with __)
