There is no starter code for this problem.

Create a class decorator called add_display_methods that automatically adds two useful methods to any class:

print(): Prints what is returned by __str__()
describes(): Prints all the object's attributes and their values

The decorator should work on any class and access the class's attributes dynamically.
